                <p>
                    Hello, I'm <span itemprop="name">Stewart Anderson</span>,
                    aged 36, I live in <span itemprop="address">York, North
                    Yorkshire</span> with my wife and two children. I'm a
                    <span itemprop="title">Software Engineer</span> for a Network
                    Security Company. Born in Scotland, I've lived in England
                    the majority of my life, pursuing a career in development
                    for the web.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of the web world, I'm a keen Amateur Photographer,
                    you can find me at 11:30pm taking pictures of the stars in
                    my back garden some nights. My other main interest is Cars,
                    a through and through petrol head, I currently have a
                    <a href="http://mk3capri.co.uk/" target="_blank">1984 Ford Capri</a>
                    in my garage, that I'm (very) slowly restoring to former
                    glory. I'm never happier than when I'm photographing cars
                    at shows throughout the country, just need to finish my car
                    so I can show it off.
