# tictactoe
Basic tic tac toe game.

Currently WIP. I'd like to explore the possibilities of storing how the player goes about the game, with averages of how they approach a game and see patterns in their play, to try to second guess where they will move next, and accommodate that move in the evaluation of the computers next move.

## Plan
- <del>User/computer takes it in turns to go first for each game</del>
- <del>Keep scores of user/computer and ties</del>
- <del>Use localStorage to persist previous state</del>
- Keep a track of players moves
