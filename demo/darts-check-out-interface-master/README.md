# Darts Check Out Interface
A fun project that started whilst watching the darts, the project draws a canvas dartboard that you can play a game of 501, as soon as a finish becomes available you will see all possible variants.

On the todo list:

+   Fanfare when you get 180!
+   Reset/new game feature
+   Two player mode...
